<p>Lot of things to do!</p>
<p>This was continuously revovlving around my head for last 2 weeks. I had to
deploy the work i had done on staging instance and test it. But wait! I had
never written a setup.py before, never made a RPM package before.</p>
<p>While in college, I had a fascination toward RPM packaging as most of my
college seniors had created a RPM package sometime or other. During Mukti
2011, I had attended a RPM packaging workshop by Rahul Sundaram(mether), so i had the idea of how to package a RPM.</p>
<p>But well before that i had to write a setup script for darkserver. Though the basic setup.py did not take much time, but i got stuck when it came to
include staticfiles in setup.py. After a lot of googling and seraching, the
result was null. So i asked in #python IRC channel, when Ned Batchelder
helped me out. Finally, I got a link to package a Django app titled-
Packaging a Django resuable app</p>
<p>After completing writing setup.py, I started working on building RPM
packaging. Here are some links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines?rd=Packaging/Guidelines">Packaging:Guidlines</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package">How to create an RPM package</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Python">Packaging:Python</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After completing rpm packaging, it’s time for koji scratch build. And i did it
but while installing it in the staging instance, something happened. I had
used target as rawhide instead of dist-6E-epel while koji scratch build.
Nevermind, I repeated the steps and voilà, i successfully perform a fresh
install of the package and everything was working properly.:)</p>
<p>And, with that Google Summer of Code came to an End.</p>
