<h2 id="what-is-gtd">What is GTD?</h2>
<p>GTD abbr for &ldquo;Getting Things Done&rdquo; &ndash; is a framework for organizing and
tracking your tasks and projects. Its aim is to make you have 100% trust in a
system for collecting tasks, ideas, and projects.</p>
<p>The lists you have to maintain:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>In</code></li>
<li><code>Next actions</code></li>
<li><code>Waiting for</code></li>
<li><code>Projects</code></li>
<li><code>Some day/maybe</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-in-list">The <code>in</code> list</h2>
<p>The <code>in</code> list is where you capture all your ideas whenever they occur to you.
This can be anything and process is just emptying your brain and putting it
into the <code>in</code> list.</p>
<h4 id="processing-the-in-list">Processing the <code>in</code> list</h4>
<p>The items in the list should processed one by one in the order they appear on
your list.</p>
<p>Ask <strong>is it actionable</strong> &ndash;&gt; if No, then throw it away if you don&rsquo;t need it
anymore or move to &ldquo;some day/maybe list&rdquo; or <strong>incubate</strong> it &ndash;&gt; add it to
<em>tickler file</em>.</p>
<p>if Yes, Plan the next action that needs to be performed. Spend a little extra
time planning how the things need to be executed (If the action takes less
than two minutes to perform then just do it). If more than 2 minutes delegate
to the <code>Next Actions</code> list or move to <code>Waiting for</code> list if it depends on
something. <code>Next Actions</code> is probably the place where most of the things will
land up.  If the open loop will take more than one action to close, the overall
goal should also be noted on a <code>Projects</code> list.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-actions-list">The <code>Next Actions</code> list</h2>
<p>The <code>next actions</code> list contains the list of things that you plan to perform.
This can also be said as <strong>as-soon-as-possible actions</strong>. Things which you will
work on whenever free.</p>
<h2 id="the-waiting-for-list">The <code>Waiting-for</code> list</h2>
<p>The <code>Waiting-for</code> list contains the list of things that would be list of task
you are waiting on somebodies action.</p>
<h2 id="projects"><code>Projects</code></h2>
<p>The <code>Projects</code> list contains the list of <code>next actions</code>. If anything that takes
more that one <code>next actions</code> to complete can be combined into a project.
Completing the tasks one by one takes one one step closer to completing the
project.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to write down the goal of the project maybe as a description so that
it helps in focusing on the goal.</p>
<h2 id="contexts"><code>Contexts</code></h2>
<p>The contexts are basically <code>tags</code> to actions. It is a common practice to add
<code>@</code> when context is a location.</p>
<p><code>Agenda Contexts</code> - Agenda context is setting an agenda for a certain type of
work. For example for everday meeting you can add the agenda context to all the
actions that needs to be discussed.

<h2 id="the-somedaymaybe-list">The <code>someday/maybe</code> list</h2>
<p>Projects and Ideas which does not need immediate attention but surely needs
attention when you have time goes into <code>someday/maybe</code> list. This list should
be reviewed weekly along with the rest of the system during the weekly review.</p>
<h2 id="calendar"><code>Calendar</code></h2>
<p>The <code>calendar</code> is for doing things on a certain time and date.Only keep time
sensitive activities in list so that it does not get diluted.</p>
<h2 id="weekly-review"><code>Weekly Review</code></h2>
<p>This is one of the critical factors for the success of the <code>GTD Framework</code>. The
<code>weekly review</code> needs to be done once per week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Review each of the <code>next action</code>. Each project should have atleast one <code>next action</code>. Only keep the items which you can do in the coming week else move it
to <code>someday/maybe</code> list. If you don’t think you will ever do it—remove it
completely.</li>
<li>Look through your someday/maybe list and see if some <code>projects/actions</code> should
be moved to the list of current <code>projects/the next actions</code> list. If creating a
new project on your projects list, make sure to figure out its next physical,
visible action and put it on the next actions list as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trigger-list"><code>Trigger</code> List</h2>
<p>Trigger List is a list of <code>keywords</code> which is useful to trigger thoughts/ideas
floating around your head during brain dumps.
<a href="https://hackmake.org/reference/gtd-trigger-list">Read</a></p>
<h2 id="tools---read-and-review">Tools - <code>Read and Review</code></h2>
<p>A <code>read/review</code> folder is a list of documents that you maintain to read.
Whenever you have some minutes to kill you can refer to this list.</p>
<h2 id="tools---tickler-file">Tools - <code>Tickler</code> file</h2>
<p>If you need sometime on a specific date and time. Maintain this the <em>action
item</em> will only pop up on that specific date and time.</p>
