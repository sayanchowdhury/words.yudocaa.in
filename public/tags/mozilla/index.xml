      <description>I have been involved in Durgapur Linux User&amp;rsquo;s Group for around last five years. I have been contributing to various open source projects quite sometime. The primary reason on why I contribute to open source is the feeling, the enjoyment when you send a patch or a PR to a open source project. It makes you happy when millions of people use your few lines of code in day to day life.</description>

      <description>I could not sleep the night i got the invitation mail from Mozilla to attend Mozilla Summit 2013. I was roaming around my college hostel waking up everybody from their sleep just to tell them that “I have been invited to Mozilla Summit 2013 at Santa Clara, CA”. I was really very excited as this was be my first international travel.
Finally the month of October came. rtnpro and I left for bangalore airport early (all due to exitement).</description>
