      <description>I left early for the venue as haseeb had the first talk of the day and I was volunteering for the Python track.
The day started off with a talk by Stephanie Taylor on Introduction to GSoC, and GCI. She talked about the programs Google Summer of Code and Google Code In. She shared some statistics from the past years. The students of GCI last year completed more than 4k tasks, among them 1k+ was done by the students under FOSSASIA organization.</description>
