      <description>Autocloud was released during the Fedora 23 cycle as a part of the Two Week Atomic Process.
Previously, it used to listen to fedmsg for successful Koji builds. Whenever, there is a new message the AutocloudConsumer queues these message for processing. The Autocloud job service then listens to the queue, downloads the images and runs the tests using Tunir. A more detailed post about it&amp;rsquo;s release can be read here.</description>
