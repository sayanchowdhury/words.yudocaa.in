      <description>I could not sleep the night i got the invitation mail from Mozilla to attend Mozilla Summit 2013. I was roaming around my college hostel waking up everybody from their sleep just to tell them that “I have been invited to Mozilla Summit 2013 at Santa Clara, CA”. I was really very excited as this was be my first international travel.
Finally the month of October came. rtnpro and I left for bangalore airport early (all due to exitement).</description>

      <description>Python Month I attended last year’s PyCon India, while in college and it was a great experience. After shifting to Bangalore this year, I thought why not volunteer Pycon India this year.
I was a regular attendee to the Pycon India meetings held at the Goibibo office at M.G.Road. This year it was thought to celebrate the month of August Python Month as a part of PyCon this year. As a part of Python Month, volunteers would go to various college across the country to evangelize and teach python to college students.</description>
