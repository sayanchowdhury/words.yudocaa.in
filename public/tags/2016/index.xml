      <description>The PyLadies Pune February Meetup was held on 6th Feb at reserved-bit. Kushal took a session on MicroPython on the MicroBit boards. Thanks to @ntoll for sending over the MicroBits for workshops.
I reached down to the venue a bit late. On reaching the venue, Kushal told me that he forgot the boards at home and I went to his place to pick the MicroBits.
  Most of the participants were regular participants for the meetup so Kushal took a quick course on Python.</description>

      <description>I left early for the venue as haseeb had the first talk of the day and I was volunteering for the Python track.
The day started off with a talk by Stephanie Taylor on Introduction to GSoC, and GCI. She talked about the programs Google Summer of Code and Google Code In. She shared some statistics from the past years. The students of GCI last year completed more than 4k tasks, among them 1k+ was done by the students under FOSSASIA organization.</description>

      <description>FOSSASIA 2016, Asia&amp;rsquo;s premier conference on Free and Open Software was held at Science Center, Singapore.
I arrived Singapore 18th morning, the same day the event was starting. Due to track issues, the metro was running late and I reached the venue around 1100 local time. I directly went to the auditorium where the event was happening. I had already missed the morning talks. It was Tea break when I reached.</description>

      <description>On 15th January 2016, we had our first Fedora meetup at Pune. The venue was earlier decided to be Red Hat office, Pune but due to unavailability of space the meetup was moved to my apartment.
The meetup was scheduled to start around 14:30 IST but with people pouring in a bit late, we started the event at 15:00 IST. The turnout was good and much more than what we had expected with a total of 18 people turning out.</description>
