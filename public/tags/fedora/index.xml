      <title>Redesigning fedimg (Part 2): Communication with AWS</title>
      <link>https://words.yudocaa.in/blog/redesigning-fedimg-part-ii/</link>

      <description>In the previous post, I discussed what is fedimg and how it works currently. In this post, I plan to explain the issue in the current uploading process of the AMIs and how we plan to fix it.
What&amp;rsquo;s the problem? fedimg boots an utility instance using the RHEL AMI configured for that region.
The problem with this design is that while adding a new region we need to look for the appropriate RHEL AMI in the newer region first.</description>

      <description>What is fedimg? Fedimg is a Python-powered service that uploads the Fedora Cloud images on various Cloud providers. such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) .
How does it currently work? Fedimg listens to fedmsg for nightly as well as the production compose builds messages. On receiving a new message, the FedimgConsumer triggers the upload process. fedimg uses fedfind to extract the metadata for the compose from where it get&amp;rsquo;s the URL for the compressed raw image files.</description>

      <title>Autocloud: What&#39;s new?</title>

      <description>Autocloud was released during the Fedora 23 cycle as a part of the Two Week Atomic Process.
Previously, it used to listen to fedmsg for successful Koji builds. Whenever, there is a new message the AutocloudConsumer queues these message for processing. The Autocloud job service then listens to the queue, downloads the images and runs the tests using Tunir. A more detailed post about it&amp;rsquo;s release can be read here.</description>

      <description>I recently switched to use Weechat as my primary IRC client from X-Chat. I did a setup of Weechat on my Digital Ocean box.
Weechat setup turned out to be super simple and out of the box. I am running Weechat within a tmux session. But the problem I was facing was due to poor internet connection (thanks to Airtel for this and this was my primary reason for switching to weechat from Xchat) I got disconnected from the DO box quite often.</description>

Fedimg listens for the messages from Fedmsg for the Koji image builds.
Plan of work
  Add scripts to remove old AMIs we have uploaded (https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedimg/issues/37)

      <description>We developed Autocloud as a part of Fedora 23 release cycle as a part of Two week atomic image.
Autocloud publishes the messages to fedmsg when the image is queued, running, success and failed.
What is Bugyou? Bugyou files issues for failed tests from Autocloud. Bugyou is part of Fedora Project. It listens to Autocloud messages from fedmsg and files bug for images which have failed the tests. Bugyou keeps updating the status of the images in the bug and closes the issue once the tests are successful.</description>

      <description>Being a regular tmux user. Migrating a running process into tmux using reptyr comes handy.
reptyr is a utility for taking an existing running program and attaching it to a new terminal. Started a long-running process over ssh, but have to leave and don&amp;rsquo;t want to interrupt it? Just start a screen, use reptyr to grab it, and then kill the ssh session and head on home.

Lot of things to do!
This was continuously revovlving around my head for last 2 weeks. I had to deploy the work i had done on staging instance and test it. But wait! I had never written a setup.py before, never made a RPM package before.
While in college, I had a fascination toward RPM packaging as most of my college seniors had created a RPM package sometime or other.</description>

Darkserver’s command line dashboard now supports the secondary architecture. You can easily shutdown the darkproducer of specifying which architecture to shutdown.
.. code::
dark&amp;gt; shutdown darkproducer arch  The support for multiple buildqueues was removed.
After a rigorous testing on my laptop, i pushed the code to the dev instance that was assigned to me. But, a mysterious error happened, nor the pid or the daemon of darkproducer was getting created.</description>

      <description>The ‘Google Summer of Code’ code period began on June 17 and it’s already one week into it. Prior to the beginning of the coding period, I went into the depths of the darkserver codebase. In the current version of Darkserver, the link present in the libimporter are hardlinks and it is pretty well visible on Github
So, I removed the urls and the values from the libimporter and made it configurable via config files.</description>

      <description>It was worth trying to sit down with pen and paper and sketch out the compete workflow of Darkserver. I got the idea to try out this stuff from Vivek’s blogpost. Though, I could not get hold of a board but A4 did the job for me and it is really proving out to be helpful.

      <description>The Google Summer of Code 2013 results was declared on 27th May 2013, in between my semester exam so i had no time to devote until the end of my semester exams and /me returning back to my home.
With the beginning of the 2nd week of June, I started to hack around with the project, Darkserver. The project is available on GitHub.
That week was pretty much a reading week rather than coding week as I had to go through all kinds of documentation.</description>

It’s better later than never. It’s been two week since the Google Summer of Code 2013 results were announced and I am glad to say that I got selected this year.
I will be working on Darkserver Improvement under Fedora. One can see a draft of my proposal here. My mentor is Kushal Das and i am really helpful for helping me out in the whole process both in code and application.</description>
