      <description>Flock 2016 was held in the beautiful city of Krakow, Poland from August 2nd - August 5th, 2016.
Day -1 Reached Krakow tired. Spent most of the time sleeping.
Day 0 A lot of attendees started coming in. Met with a lot of people IRL whom I generally talked over on IRC. In the afternoon, we went out for the city tour. Visiting the Oskar Schindler’s Enamel Factory was a place I always wanted to visit ever since I watched the movie Schindler’s List.</description>
