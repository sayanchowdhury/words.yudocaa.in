      <description>On 9th July 2016, we had our Fedora 24 release party in Pune. The release party took place at my place. We saw a lot of familiar faces from our regular Fedora Meetup.
Chandan Kumar started the event with explaining the new features in Fedora 24. People discussed on how things has changed in Fedora 24. Parag and Siddhesh talked on how it&amp;rsquo;s important to learn things and people chipped in with their ideas.</description>
