      <description>Mukti 2014 is the annual national level technical symposium on Free and Open Source Software of the GNU/Linux Usersâ€™ Group NIT Durgapur held from 31st January - 2nd February 2014.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been attending Mukti for last four years. Unlike, the previous years when i usually attended Mukti as a student participant, this year I attended Mukti as a guest speaker.
Day 0 (30th January 2014) After a hectic travel from Bangalore to Durgapur via Kolkata.</description>

      <description>I have been involved in Durgapur Linux User&amp;rsquo;s Group for around last five years. I have been contributing to various open source projects quite sometime. The primary reason on why I contribute to open source is the feeling, the enjoyment when you send a patch or a PR to a open source project. It makes you happy when millions of people use your few lines of code in day to day life.</description>
