      <description>The PyLadies Pune February Meetup was held on 6th Feb at reserved-bit. Kushal took a session on MicroPython on the MicroBit boards. Thanks to @ntoll for sending over the MicroBits for workshops.
I reached down to the venue a bit late. On reaching the venue, Kushal told me that he forgot the boards at home and I went to his place to pick the MicroBits.
  Most of the participants were regular participants for the meetup so Kushal took a quick course on Python.</description>

      <title>Redesigning fedimg (Part 2): Communication with AWS</title>

      <description>In the previous post, I discussed what is fedimg and how it works currently. In this post, I plan to explain the issue in the current uploading process of the AMIs and how we plan to fix it.
What&amp;rsquo;s the problem? fedimg boots an utility instance using the RHEL AMI configured for that region.
The problem with this design is that while adding a new region we need to look for the appropriate RHEL AMI in the newer region first.</description>

      <description>What is fedimg? Fedimg is a Python-powered service that uploads the Fedora Cloud images on various Cloud providers. such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) .
How does it currently work? Fedimg listens to fedmsg for nightly as well as the production compose builds messages. On receiving a new message, the FedimgConsumer triggers the upload process. fedimg uses fedfind to extract the metadata for the compose from where it get&amp;rsquo;s the URL for the compressed raw image files.</description>

      <description>PyCon India, this year was held at New Delhi at the JNU Convention Center.
Dev Sprints During the Dev Sprint, Farhaan and Vivek were sprinting on Fedora Infrastructure projects primarily helping people contribute to Pagure.
Other projects/orgs like SciPy, Red Hat team, FOSSAsia, Junction etc were also sprinting.
The Dev Sprint turned out to have a good participation and couple of PRs were sent out by the participations. More than that, itâ€™s more about participants getting to know about on how to contribute.</description>

      <description>I left early for the venue as haseeb had the first talk of the day and I was volunteering for the Python track.
The day started off with a talk by Stephanie Taylor on Introduction to GSoC, and GCI. She talked about the programs Google Summer of Code and Google Code In. She shared some statistics from the past years. The students of GCI last year completed more than 4k tasks, among them 1k+ was done by the students under FOSSASIA organization.</description>

I arrived Singapore 18th morning, the same day the event was starting. Due to track issues, the metro was running late and I reached the venue around 1100 local time. I directly went to the auditorium where the event was happening. I had already missed the morning talks. It was Tea break when I reached.</description>

      <title>How to get started with Open Source</title>

      <description>I have been involved in Durgapur Linux User&amp;rsquo;s Group for around last five years. I have been contributing to various open source projects quite sometime. The primary reason on why I contribute to open source is the feeling, the enjoyment when you send a patch or a PR to a open source project. It makes you happy when millions of people use your few lines of code in day to day life.</description>
