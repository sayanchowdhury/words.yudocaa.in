      <description>The PyLadies Pune February Meetup was held on 6th Feb at reserved-bit. Kushal took a session on MicroPython on the MicroBit boards. Thanks to @ntoll for sending over the MicroBits for workshops.
I reached down to the venue a bit late. On reaching the venue, Kushal told me that he forgot the boards at home and I went to his place to pick the MicroBits.
  Most of the participants were regular participants for the meetup so Kushal took a quick course on Python.</description>

      <title>Redesigning fedimg (Part 2): Communication with AWS</title>
      <link>https://words.yudocaa.in/blog/redesigning-fedimg-part-ii/</link>

      <description>In the previous post, I discussed what is fedimg and how it works currently. In this post, I plan to explain the issue in the current uploading process of the AMIs and how we plan to fix it.
What&amp;rsquo;s the problem? fedimg boots an utility instance using the RHEL AMI configured for that region.
The problem with this design is that while adding a new region we need to look for the appropriate RHEL AMI in the newer region first.</description>

How does it currently work? Fedimg listens to fedmsg for nightly as well as the production compose builds messages. On receiving a new message, the FedimgConsumer triggers the upload process. fedimg uses fedfind to extract the metadata for the compose from where it get&amp;rsquo;s the URL for the compressed raw image files.</description>

      <description>Autocloud was released during the Fedora 23 cycle as a part of the Two Week Atomic Process.
Previously, it used to listen to fedmsg for successful Koji builds. Whenever, there is a new message the AutocloudConsumer queues these message for processing. The Autocloud job service then listens to the queue, downloads the images and runs the tests using Tunir. A more detailed post about it&amp;rsquo;s release can be read here.</description>

      <description>I recently switched to use Weechat as my primary IRC client from X-Chat. I did a setup of Weechat on my Digital Ocean box.
Weechat setup turned out to be super simple and out of the box. I am running Weechat within a tmux session. But the problem I was facing was due to poor internet connection (thanks to Airtel for this and this was my primary reason for switching to weechat from Xchat) I got disconnected from the DO box quite often.</description>

It listens to Autocloud messages from fedmsg and files bug for images which have failed the tests. Bugyou keeps updating the status of the images in the bug and closes the issue once the tests are successful.</description>

      <description>Being a regular tmux user. Migrating a running process into tmux using reptyr comes handy.
reptyr is a utility for taking an existing running program and attaching it to a new terminal. Started a long-running process over ssh, but have to leave and don&amp;rsquo;t want to interrupt it? Just start a screen, use reptyr to grab it, and then kill the ssh session and head on home.

      <description>I have been involved in Durgapur Linux User&amp;rsquo;s Group for around last five years. I have been contributing to various open source projects quite sometime. The primary reason on why I contribute to open source is the feeling, the enjoyment when you send a patch or a PR to a open source project. It makes you happy when millions of people use your few lines of code in day to day life.</description>
