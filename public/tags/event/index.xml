      <description>PyCon India, this year was held at New Delhi at the JNU Convention Center.
Dev Sprints During the Dev Sprint, Farhaan and Vivek were sprinting on Fedora Infrastructure projects primarily helping people contribute to Pagure.
Other projects/orgs like SciPy, Red Hat team, FOSSAsia, Junction etc were also sprinting.
The Dev Sprint turned out to have a good participation and couple of PRs were sent out by the participations. More than that, itâ€™s more about participants getting to know about on how to contribute.</description>
