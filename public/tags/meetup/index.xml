      <description>The PyLadies Pune February Meetup was held on 6th Feb at reserved-bit. Kushal took a session on MicroPython on the MicroBit boards. Thanks to @ntoll for sending over the MicroBits for workshops.
I reached down to the venue a bit late. On reaching the venue, Kushal told me that he forgot the boards at home and I went to his place to pick the MicroBits.
  Most of the participants were regular participants for the meetup so Kushal took a quick course on Python.</description>

      <description>On 15th January 2016, we had our first Fedora meetup at Pune. The venue was earlier decided to be Red Hat office, Pune but due to unavailability of space the meetup was moved to my apartment.
The meetup was scheduled to start around 14:30 IST but with people pouring in a bit late, we started the event at 15:00 IST. The turnout was good and much more than what we had expected with a total of 18 people turning out.</description>
