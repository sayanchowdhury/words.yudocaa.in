      <title>Force git to use git:// instead of https://</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an advocate of using SSH authentication and connecting to services like Github, Gitlab, and many others. I do make sure that the use the git:// URL while cloning the repo but sometimes I do make mistake of using the https:// instead. Only to later realise when git prompts me to enter my username to authenticate the SSH connection. This is when I have to manually reset my git remote URL.</description>

      <description>I returned to another conference with the jetlag of another conference, FOSSASIA but this conference was something I was very eagerly waiting to attend. Why? Well there are a couple of reasons, but the main reason for which I bought the ticket was to listen to Liz Rice in person.
The other reason was to see and meet the growing community of Kubernetes in Bangalore.
23rd March 2019, I woke up early morning and left along with Sayani, and Saptak to this place quite outside of Bangalore.</description>

      <description>I was back to FOSSASIA this year after a gap of an year and nothing had changed other than the venue. The event had the same level of enthusiasm as before, though the crowd seemed to be less compared to the previous years.
This FOSSASIA was more special for the participants, organizers and the volunteers because this was the 10th year of the event. Kudos, to the organizing team for doing it successfully for last 10 years!</description>

      <title>Vim, Wish I knew this about you before!</title>

      <description>Almost all my life since I have started working around open source projects I have been a Vim user. That does not mean that I did not look into other options. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried my hands on Emacs, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, Atom, et cetera. But, none of them pleased me like vim.
2018, I started working on Golang, and vim had to adapt to my needs, but it did not quite succeed and I made my switch to neovim around the end of the year.</description>

      <title>Fedora AMIs for EC2 Instances (A1) Powered by Arm-Based AWS Graviton Processors</title>

      <description>AWS recently announced their new fleet of A1 EC2 instances which is powered by ARM at AWS re:Invent.
Gladly, the Fedora Kernel Team (Laura Abbott, Justin Forbes and Jeremy Cline) and Peter Robinson had already everything in place. The only missing piece was to add the support to fedimg to create arm64 based AMIs.
With the release of fedimg==2.4.0 (thanks to Patrick), the new AMIs were happily getting uploaded to AWS and with a slight delay, Fedora had the support for the arm64 along with the x86_64 AMIs.</description>

      <description>Saturday, I am sitting at a Starbucks in Bangalore, trying my hands on a Golang project. I come across this argument -d in go get: The go CLI help says:
 The -d flag instructs get to stop after downloading the packages; that is, it instructs get not to install the packages.

      <description>2013 The year I graduated from a third-tier college in Durgapur. I did not expect much from the college, mostly because of the poor placement record in the college.
To get myself a job, I was primarily going through hasjob.co and any job opportunities that came through Bangpypers mailing list.
Finally, I landed myself into an internship and later which turned into a full-time at HackerEarth was through the hasjob.co.</description>

      <title>Exit Vim in between Git operation</title>

      <description>Long I have been procrastinating over this. Whenever I had to quit out of the Vim while doing git-rebase interactively I would be going over to a new terminal window, and perform git rebase --abort and then close the other window too.
Today, I learned if you ever want to quit Vim either while committing or rebasing, just do :cq. This quits Vim with an error code, and Git will abort the action.</description>

      <description>Itâ€™s been a while that Amazon introduced Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) Support to their cloud. Amazon EC2 provides enhanced networking capabilities to C5, C5 with instance storage, F1, G3, H1, I3, m4.16xlarge, M5, P2, P3, R4, and X1 instances through the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA).
With the Fedora 28 release, the Fedora AMIs come with the ENA support.
To check whether an AMI has the Enhanced Networking with ENA-Enabled, you can query the AWS EC2 API, using the AWS Command Line Interface.</description>
