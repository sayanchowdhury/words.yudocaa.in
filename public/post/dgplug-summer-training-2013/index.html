            <p>The time has come again this year for the dgplug summer training.</p>
<p>The summer training is conducted each year during the month of June. Though, we
cannot call June as the summer season but end of June is a suitable time for
most of the Indian students. During this summer training, a number of upstream
developers give talk on various open-source technologies. This guides the
student on how to contribute back to open source. At the end of the summer
training the student get a project which gives a strong base of the language as
well as programming skills.</p>
<p>Speaking on a personal note, I did this training twice, first in 2010, then in
2011 and this training helped me pave my career path. It gave me a lot of
exposure. It injected in me the habit of self-dependence, googling out your own
problems, hungry for knowledge of new ideas etc. Being a student of a private
engineering college, where project for any student meant any kind of online
management system, this training helped me think beyond that and go for solving
real life problems.</p>
<p>The details of the training can be found at <a href="http://dgplug.org/summertraining">dgplug summer
training</a> or you can
shoot a mail at <strong>kushaldas AT gmail DOT com</strong> for more details.</p>
