          <p>It&rsquo;s very hard to write but I am leaving HackerEarth.</p>
<h2 id="2013-and-internship">2013 and internship</h2>
<p>My college days were coming to an end with placements all around. I was sure to
join in a startup. One fine day, I saw a job posting on hasjob on 12th December
2012 that boldly said &ldquo;HackerEarth is buidling its initial team - Python/Django enthusiast needed&rdquo;.
The idea made me apply to HackerEarth and after a few rounds of email with Sachin and Vivek.
I landed up in a remote intern position.</p>
<p>My first task at HackerEarth as an intern was to implement Auth/Profile system
for Codetable. Damn! My first task itself was a daunting task. There was so
many permutaiton of things to take care of private digest, public digest,
read-only mode, read-write mode, authenticated user, anonymous user. 10 days
into the internship the auth system was finally working. Finally, the code was
deployed and the feeling was amazing.</p>
<p>Four months into the internship, I got a full time position at HackerEarth. I
joined the team at their Bangalore office in July 2013.</p>
<h2 id="working-at-hackerearth">Working at HackerEarth</h2>
<p>The office I joined was Bangalore Alpha Labs, Koramangala. In the span of
two years, I worked on a couple of things. I have worked on the Recruiter Panel,
Plagiarism Detection Engine, Profile pages, Challenges pages, HackerEarth Shorterner and
for the past one year I have been working on HackerEarth Sprints.</p>
<p>HackerEarth has scaled at a very rapid rate and the engineering team at
HackerEarth to learn at a more faster pace to keep things going. At
HackerEarth, as a full-stack engineer I got to know the deep knowledge of what
it takes to keep a website running at such a huge scale.</p>
<h2 id="life-at-hackerearth">Life at HackerEarth</h2>
<p>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! I never felt here that I was out of
college. Food fests, hardware hacking, TT, packs of Redbulls, movie and gaming
nights and flexible timings. Anything that had to keep a developer going we had it all.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>I have been using Fedora since the initial days of my college. An year, I was
contributing to Fedora. I have been working on Fedora Infrastructure projects
after regular office hours and weekends. I have been also involved in
evangelizing Fedora and organizing Fedora meetups.</p>
<p>But now I will be joining the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Engineering"><strong>Fedora Engineering
Team</strong></a> working on Fedora as a
part of my day job. Looking forward to scale more mountains and see what rocks
life throws at me at my new role at Fedora.</p>
