        <div class="post-content">
          <p>26th of October 2015, I joined <a href="http://www.redhat.com/"><strong>Red Hat</strong></a> as a part of the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Engineering"><strong>Fedora Engineering
Team</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I have been contributing to the Fedora for couple of years now starting from
the contributing to <a href="https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel"><strong>askbot-devel</strong></a> while we were gearing up for the <a href="https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/questions/"><strong>Ask
Fedora</strong></a> release. This year in July, I along with <a href="kushaldas.in"><strong>kushal</strong></a>, <a href="www.rtnpro.com"><strong>rtnpro</strong></a>, <a href="http://kumar-pravin.blogspot.in/"><strong>praveenkumar</strong></a>
started working on <a href="github.com/kushaldas/autocloud"><strong>Autocloud</strong></a>, as a part of the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Two_Week_Atomic"><strong>Two-Week Atomic</strong></a> during the
Fedora 23 cycle. So, I last couple of years of I have met and worked with a lot
of people in the Fedora community. Joining Fedora was like working with
friends.</p>
<p>I joined as a remotee working from Pune. I will be primarily working
on different applications in the <a href="github.com/fedora-infra/"><strong>Fedora Infrastructure</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="first-week">First Week</h2>
<p>I was handed over a Lenovo Thinkpad T450s, it turned out to be a good working
machine with good configs. I started using <a href="http://www.mutt.org/"><strong>mutt</strong></a> as my email client, <a href="http://www.passwordstore.org/"><strong>pass</strong></a> for
managing passwords, <a href="taskwarrior.org"><strong>taskwarrior</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ralphbean/bugwarrior/"><strong>bugwarrior</strong></a> to manage my tasks and bugs.</p>
<p>Chalked out a plan for <a href="piratepad.ca/p/bugyou"><strong>Bugyou</strong></a> and worked on a POC. <a href="pagure.io/bugyou/"><strong>Bugyou</strong></a> is an automatic bug
reporting tool that consumes the messages from fedmsg and file bugs to
different bug tracking tools for registered topics. I wrote down a fedmsg
consumer that would be consuming the failed and the successful messages and file
tickets from them <a href="pagure.io"><strong>pagure</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="second-and-third-week">Second and Third Week.</h2>
<p>During these two weeks, my primary focus was on deploying Bugyou. I fixed a
couple of bugs in <a href="https://pagure.io/libpagure/"><strong>libpagure</strong></a>, which is a Python library for the Pagure APIs.
I started packaging python-libpagure and making it ready for deployment as it
was dependecies for Bugyou. python-libpagure being my first RPM package I spent
a lot of time reading through the guidelines, fixing the issues in accordance to the review
given in the <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1281739"><strong>review request</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I added some management commands for Autocloud to abort long running task and
also to re-queue tasks. I also started with learning golang and wrote a minimalist
logging framework from <a href="https://pagure.io/brume"><strong>brume</strong></a>.</p>
<p>We also had a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Python_3_Porting_2015"><strong>Python3 Porting FAD</strong></a> on November 14-15 where I ported the
python-retask to Python 3. <a href="github.com/kushaldas/retask/"><strong>Retask</strong></a> is a python module to create and
manage distributed task queue/job queue.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-week">Fourth Week</h2>
<p>I worked with a <a href="https://pagure.io/pagure/pull-request/491"><strong>feature</strong></a> in pagure to show the list of commits before a
particular commit hex. I gave a demo of Bugyou the <a href="https://youtu.be/bkEXz601kM4"><strong>Fedora Release Engineering Tools Demo</strong></a>.
At the end of the week, I had my New Hire Orientation programme where I learnt
more about the culture, people and met new people at Red Hat.</p>
<p><strong>It seems to be exciting road ahead!</strong>.</p>
<p>Currently, I am working on a <a href="https://github.com/sayanchowdhury/bugyou/blob/develop/docs/diagrams/bugyou.txt"><strong>new architecture</strong></a> for Bugyou. If you are looking forward to help, come to #fedora-apps on freenode.</p>
