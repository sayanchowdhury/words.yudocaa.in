This is accompanied with [Hope](/fitness/)

This is to maintain a daily journal of the efforts. This is to be seen from bottom
to top.

To explain the jargons:

- cw: current weight
- gw: goal weight

Ok, lets start.

### January 29, 2021

```
- cw: 77.20
```

Went to market and walked around 4 kms and later 6 kms as usual at night, but the
weight remained the same. So good :)

### January 28, 2021

```
- cw: 77.20
```

Casual walk last night, talking with Chandan, Anirudha and Ritesh about PyCon
India. 6 kms in 1h 3m, did not even realize. Smooth!
But! But! But! The weight drop is too high. Increase trend tomorrow maybe

### January 27, 2021

```
- cw: 77.95

Back to exercise again with clocking 11k steps, and the good news is
I walked 6 kms in 56 mins. That's a good timing. VO2 Max went up a bit.


### January 26, 2021

```
- cw: 78.40
```

No exercise again because we had a feast at our house but tomorrow for sure

### January 25, 2021

```
- cw: 78.15
```

Another day of no exercise, mostly to maintain weight. I would need to find a way
to eat better and also lot and not skip exercise.

### January 24, 2021

```
- cw: 78.25
```

Walked a 10k last night, and also completed the 100 kms challenge for the month.
Pretty good number to start off January 2021. Guilty of having sumptuous meal as
well which explains the rise in weight.

### January 23, 2021

```
- cw: 77.70
```

No exercise. I've dropped a lot this week. I need to gain some by eating healthy.
Another week coming to an end. Need to pick up Freeletics again from next week.

### January 22, 2021

```
- cw: 77.65
```

A regular day, walked 6 kms at peak night, I really need to change my timings.
Bring back when I walked in evening, for this I need to start the day early, and
finish early.

### January 21, 2021

```
- cw: 77.75
```
Yay! Hit my first goal weight. But I'm dropping quick, not really healthy. I need
to intake more food given the exercise I'm doing. Did complete 5 kms, under
45 mins. I really need try to get the exercise by evening, and not at midnight.

I've probably woken up bunch of people with my loud thumping noise while walking.
Blame my shoe, not me. :)

### January 20, 2021

```
- cw: 78.1
```

Started the morning with 5.13 kms walk, approximately 7000 steps and then ending
with day with 2.81 kms walk, with another 3500 steps. A total of ~12000 steps.
Still fighting with diet, bulk cooking will surely come handy in the long run.

### January 19, 2021

```
- cw: 79.05
```

Freeletics, a light one. Started with the diet that dietician suggested. The diet
is not really fancy but more focused with the same things I love to have at home.

Also, started the day quite early and went for a morning walk rather than at night
Trying to switch gears so that at night it's mostly a stroll.

### January 18, 2021

```
- cw: 79.30
```

Feeling tried about the whole day of cleaning, so gave myself some rest. Also,
treated the day as a cheat day after 2 weeks which I feel is apt. Keeping habits
up and running in this freezing cold is very difficult. I'm a lazy person at
heart :)

Second week of tracking comes to a closure. 11 more to go.

### January 17, 2021

```
- cw: 79.10
```

Sick again, maybe did not recover. Seems like body needs rest. I though did 3.5
kms walk.

### January 16, 2021

```
- cw: 78.70
```

Back doing Freeletics again. Yesterday was a killer day, maybe it was scheduled to
be the first of the week. Also, I added wall, and pullup bar as equipment and
Freeletics listened. The coach added a couple of pullup exercises. Later, walked
3.5 kms at a slow pace of ~12 min/km.


### January 15, 2021

```
- cw: 78.80
```

Another sick day. Could not do Freeletics again. Hopefully to resume it on Friday.
Felt better by dinner so went on a walk and did a 6 kms in an hour. Good thing I
clocked 9.x min/km pace bunch of times yesterday

### January 14, 2021

```
- cw: 79.45
```

Zero gain, Zero loss. Sickness continues. Walked 6kms in an hour, though first
time I had to take 3-4 breaks in between. Also, felt more tired than the general.


### January 13, 2021

```
- cw: 79.45
```

Planned Freeletics, but was down with fever so skipped Freeletics. Though, had
an hour long meeting at night during which I did a walk covering 5.15 kms.

### January 12, 2021

```
- cw: 79.95
```

Yesterday walked in two sets of 3.6 kms and 3.13 kms. The former in the morning
and the later in the evening. Today is the dreaded day of freeletics.

### January 11, 2021

```
- cw: 80.05
```

First week of tracking completes. Completed a set of Freeleticss first thing in
the morning and ended the day with 3.52 kms with a pace of 11:02 min/km.

### January 10, 2021

```
- cw: 80.60
```

I hit 5 kms walk broken into various smaller walks, because I was out and managed
to squeeze in some walk. Also, had a late dinner with carbs. Weekends might me a
nightmare so I need to come up with plans to keep maintaining my routine.

Tomorrow we complete 1 week of tracking. 12 more to go. ðŸ¤ž

### January 09, 2021

```
- cw: 80.30
```
Completed Freeletics in the morning on empty stomach. It was HARD! Then completed
walking 6.15 kms in the evening with a decent pace of 10:41 min/km.

### January 08, 2021

```
- cw: 80.60
```
Chill day. Gave body some time to recover from the Freeletics excercise. I am
also trying out biphasic sleep, so left in the afternoon hours. Went for a walk
in the evening and covered 6 kms with a pace of 10:45 /km. Another thing I tried
was ending the day with drinking cold water instead of hot.

### January 07, 2021

```
- cw: 81.1
```
Not good, weight increased again. Probably because hitting drinking 3L water everyday.
Though did my set of Freeletics yesterday, and 5 kms of walk. I might need to
move my towards the wee hours in morning.

### January 06, 2021

```
- cw: 80.80 kgs
```

Casual walk along in the night, 3.51 kms with 9.42/km average. Very happy to come
below 10. Missed skipping because had to tutor Risha for her computer exams.

### January 05, 2021

```
- cw: 80.70 kgs
```

I went for a regular walk covering 3.62 kms with 10:49/km average. Not bad, but can
do better. Also, did the Freeletics set. Easy sets, but few were brutal.

### January 04, 2021

```
- cw: 81.55 kgs
```

I went for a regular walk as usual but could not do much as because I was wearing
the sandals. Flat feet curse! Need to wear the shoes. Covered only 2.57 kms limping.
