To explain the jargons:

Ok, lets start.

### January 07, 2021

```
- cw: 81.1
```
Not good, weight increased again. Probably because hitting drinking 3L water everyday.
Though did my set of Freeletics yesterday, and 5 kms of walk. I might need to
move my towards the wee hours in morning.

### January 06, 2021

```
- cw: 80.80 kgs
```

Casual walk along in the night, 3.51 kms with 9.42/km average. Very happy to come
below 10. Missed skipping because had to tutor Risha for her computer exams.

### January 05, 2021

```
- cw: 80.70 kgs
```

I went for a regular walk covering 3.62 kms with 10:49/km average. Not bad, but can
do better. Also, did the Freeletics set. Easy sets, but few were brutal.

### January 04, 2021

```
- cw: 81.55 kgs
```

I went for a regular walk as usual but could not do much as because I was wearing
the sandals. Flat feet curse! Need to wear the shoes. Covered only 2.57 kms limping.
