Sick again, maybe did not recover. Seems like body needs rest. I though did 3.5
kms walk.

Back doing Freeletics again. Yesterday was a killer day, maybe it was scheduled to
be the first of the week. Also, I added wall, and pullup bar as equipment and
Freeletics listened. The coach added a couple of pullup exercises. Later, walked
3.5 kms at a slow pace of ~12 min/km.


### January 15, 2021

```
- cw: 78.80
```

Another sick day. Could not do Freeletics again. Hopefully to resume it on Friday.
Felt better by dinner so went on a walk and did a 6 kms in an hour. Good thing I
clocked 9.x min/km pace bunch of times yesterday

### January 14, 2021

```
- cw: 79.45
```

Zero gain, Zero loss. Sickness continues. Walked 6kms in an hour, though first
time I had to take 3-4 breaks in between. Also, felt more tired than the general.


### January 13, 2021

```
- cw: 79.45
```

Planned Freeletics, but was down with fever so skipped Freeletics. Though, had
an hour long meeting at night during which I did a walk covering 5.15 kms.

### January 12, 2021

```
- cw: 79.95
```

Yesterday walked in two sets of 3.6 kms and 3.13 kms. The former in the morning
and the later in the evening. Today is the dreaded day of freeletics.

### January 11, 2021

- cw: 80.05

First week of tracking completes. Completed a set of Freeleticss first thing in
the morning and ended the day with 3.52 kms with a pace of 11:02 min/km.

### January 10, 2021

```
- cw: 80.60
```

I hit 5 kms walk broken into various smaller walks, because I was out and managed
to squeeze in some walk. Also, had a late dinner with carbs. Weekends might me a
nightmare so I need to come up with plans to keep maintaining my routine.

Tomorrow we complete 1 week of tracking. 12 more to go. ðŸ¤ž

### January 09, 2021

Completed Freeletics in the morning on empty stomach. It was HARD! Then completed
walking 6.15 kms in the evening with a decent pace of 10:41 min/km.

### January 08, 2021

- cw: 80.60

Chill day. Gave body some time to recover from the Freeletics excercise. I am
also trying out biphasic sleep, so left in the afternoon hours. Went for a walk
in the evening and covered 6 kms with a pace of 10:45 /km. Another thing I tried
was ending the day with drinking cold water instead of hot.

### January 07, 2021

```
- cw: 81.1
```
Not good, weight increased again. Probably because hitting drinking 3L water everyday.
Though did my set of Freeletics yesterday, and 5 kms of walk. I might need to
move my towards the wee hours in morning.

### January 06, 2021

```
- cw: 80.80 kgs
```

Casual walk along in the night, 3.51 kms with 9.42/km average. Very happy to come
below 10. Missed skipping because had to tutor Risha for her computer exams.

### January 05, 2021

```
- cw: 80.70 kgs
```

I went for a regular walk covering 3.62 kms with 10:49/km average. Not bad, but can
do better. Also, did the Freeletics set. Easy sets, but few were brutal.

### January 04, 2021

```
- cw: 81.55 kgs
```

I went for a regular walk as usual but could not do much as because I was wearing
the sandals. Flat feet curse! Need to wear the shoes. Covered only 2.57 kms limping.
