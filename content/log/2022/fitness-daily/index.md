This is accompanied with [Hope](/fitness/)

This is to maintain a daily journal of the efforts. This is to be seen from bottom
to top.

To explain the jargons:

- cw: current weight
- gw: goal weight

Ok, lets start.

### September 12, 2022

```
- cw: 80.3 kgs
```

Starting off things again, After coming back to Bangalore, I had a tough time setting
things up, so mostly was eating food from outside and gained like 10kgs in the past
month, haha!

This time it's bit different from the last as I will be hitting the gym, and walking
as well. Let's see how it goes!

To begin, I started with a 15min walk on treadmill with 6kmph and incline 10.
In the evening, I went for a walk of 1.53km with a pace of 10:05min/km

I chugged a total of 1.25L of water yesterday. Need to bring this up to 4L a day.
