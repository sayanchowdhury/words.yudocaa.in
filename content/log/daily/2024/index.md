Comparatively, it's been a good day. It's been pure motivation at the moment, need
to turn it around in consistency. I did not get to walk, but I've just started to
track everything. Went to meet friends in the evening that rocked the schedule a bit.

Hello 2024!

2023 surely hasn't been a good year in terms of staying healthy. I've been eating
a lot, and that shows. I've gained 15 kgs in a just a span of a year, and I don't
feel well. I've a trek towards the end of the year and I need to start working out
and feel stronger. Be light and swift!
