This is accompanied with [Hope](/fitness/2024)

This is to maintain a daily journal of the efforts. This is to be seen from bottom
to top.

To explain the jargons:

- cw: current weight
- gw: goal weight

Ok, lets start.

A good day, I went to the gym in the morning, followed by a good meal. I still need
to work on my sleep but overall I would rate the day good. I also seem to enter
the weight from where the challenge would begin. Good that I set the initial goal
weight to be 81kgs.

Here is the workout log:
```
Glute Bridges: 1 min x 2
Plank Hold: 1 min x 2
Tricep Back dips: 15 x 3
Bicep curls: 5kg x 15 x 3
Walking Lunges: 5kg x 10 x 3
Kettlebell Squats: 10kg x 10 x 4
Skips: a couple, learning the form from Jackson
Dumbell Bench Press: 5kg x 10 x 3 (again learning the form)
```

In terms of food, I did have a late breakfast after the workout, followed by a late
lunch, which did include salad - but I made sure I had a early dinner.

An okay day of focus, too much out of pure motivation rather than will. I drank
good enough water, but I need to drink more. Afternoon went for a workout session,
which was moderate but scope of improvement. Food habits okay, as still trying to
get into the regime.

Comparatively, it's been a good day. It's been pure motivation at the moment, need
to turn it around in consistency. I did not get to walk, but I've just started to
track everything. Went to meet friends in the evening that rocked the schedule a bit.

Hello 2024!

2023 surely hasn't been a good year in terms of staying healthy. I've been eating
a lot, and that shows. I've gained 15 kgs in a just a span of a year, and I don't
feel well. I've a trek towards the end of the year and I need to start working out
and feel stronger. Be light and swift!
