This weekend there will be a [soldering
workshop](http://bit.ly/rb-soldering-bw) conducted at
[reserved-bit](https://reserved-bit.com/). The workshop is on 5th Feb 2017 from
10:00 - 13:00. 

The 3-hour workshop plans cover to the following topics

- Electricity basics & Ohmâ€™s Law Electronics basics
- Circuit components
- What is a solder?
- More on soldering equipment
- Practice session
- Making your own circuit (Carry it home)

Turns out I bought the first ticket for the workshop. I had couple of
failed attempts of learning to solder due to which I usually ended going to a electrical
shop to get my circuits soldered. Performing a cleaning soldering has always
been an issue for me.

Hopefully with this workshop I can get rid of that dependency.

If you are centered around Pune, then register you can [register](http://bit.ly/rb-soldering-bw) for the workshop. Do remember to register asap because afaik the seats are limited.
