I have been involved in [Durgapur Linux User's
Group](http://dgplug.org/) for around last five years. I have been
contributing to various open source projects quite sometime. The primary
reason on why I contribute to open source is the feeling, the enjoyment
when you send a patch or a PR to a open source project. It makes you
happy when millions of people use your few lines of code in day to day
life.

After getting through [Google Summer of
Code](http://www.google-melange.com/) and getting covered in [Super
Student](http://yourstory.com/2013/09/super-student-sayan-chowdhury-python-and-open-source-developer/),
a lot of people contacted me. All of them had the same set of questions.

1.  How to get started?
2.  I know x,y,z languages. which project should i contribute?
3.  How can i filter out a bug?

So, I thought of writing a blog post in which i'll try to answer the
questions. But, first let us overview on what is Open Source Software.

**What is Open Source Software(OSS)?**

Open Source Software is a computer software whose source code is made
publically available for modification and enhancements released under
various licenses. "[What is open
source?](http://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)" is a good
read.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe in the fact that reading few lines of code is more worth than
read 500 pages of a book. When you follow code written by great
programmers you automatically tend to pickup some great practices while
coding.

Even before I studied the subject Software Engineering in college, I had
practical knowledge of version control systems, debuggers, issue
trackers, continuous integration tools and this was all because of
contributing to a open source project.

You make a great resume that stands out from the crowd. Contributing to
open source software helps you building online presence.

But, these merry words really are not much help to get you started.

**How do I get started?**

The first and the foremost thing is choose a programming language of
your choice. Once you are done with selecting a programming language,
search for a project you might be interested.

[Open Hatch](https://openhatch.org/) is just for beginners like you. The
search page of Open Hatch filters out bugs based on

-   Languages
-   Projects

Mozilla too has a wide range of projects filter based on programming
language. [What can I do for Mozilla?](http://http://goo.gl/FDQibQ/)

**How do I filter out a bug?**

Truly speaking, finding a bug for a beginner is really a hard job. I
faced the same problems. But i'll be listing down on how to find easy
bugs and get started with contributing a large organization.

Fedora
======

[Fedora Easy Fix page](http://fedoraproject.org/easyfix/) list down all
the easy fixes you can get started with. Each project lists down whom
you need to contact and the maintainer of the project.

Fedora Infrastructure respositories contain some easy fixes. Look for
the *EasyFix* label in the repository issues section.
[<https://github.com/fedora-infra>](https://github.com/fedora-infra)

Mozilla
=======

Getting started with Mozilla is damn simple. Mozilla has multiple
gateway for their fellow new contributors.

1.  [What can I do for mozilla?](http://www.whatcanidoformozilla.org)

This site suggests you project based on the programming skill you
select. Once you decide you project it takes you to the respective
mozilla project.

2.  [Bugs Ahoy!](http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/)

Bugs Ahoy is a site particularly for the new contributors. The website
categorizes the 'Easy bugs' and 'Mentored Bugs' based on the various
project like JS Engine, Devtools, Firefox OS etc.

But, what if you don't know which project is based out of which
programming language. Bugs Ahoy categorizes the easy bugs based on the
programming languages too primarily Python, Java, Shell, JS, C/C++,
HTML/CSS. One can combine the combination of filters to choose the
perfect bug to get started.

3.  Mozilla Getting Involved Pages.

Mozilla has Getting Involved which list down the projects in a
particular team The projects contains

-   The mentors who can be contacted
-   Bugzilla page
-   IRC channel name
-   List of mentored bugs

KDE
===

If you want to start contributing to KDE, look out for the **Junior
Jobs** tag. Like each organization KDE too contains a section on how to
get started with the KDE projects.

-   Getting Started -
    [<http://techbase.kde.org/Contribute>](http://techbase.kde.org/Contribute)

    [<https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-devel>](https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-devel)

OpenStack
=========

OpenStack is also a great project to start with. The OpenStack project
is divided into various components: Swift, Glance, Nova, Horizon,
Keystone etc. Each of these components have their own page. If you head
over to the [OpenStack Wiki Main
page](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Main_Page), you can see the
components listed seperately.

Each Component page contains the link to repository, bug
tracker(Launchpad), Documentation etc. OpenStack call their beginner
bugs as "**Low Hanging Fruit**".

-   Getting Started -
    [<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute>](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute)
-   If you are a developer -
    [<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute#If_you.27re_a_developer>](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute#If_you.27re_a_developer)

Most of the people on the planet have heard of the name Wikipedia but
ever thought of contributing to it. Wikipedia is supported by Wikimedia
Foundation. Mediawiki tag their easy bugs with the easy tag.
[Click!](https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/buglist.cgi?bug_severity=normal&bug_severity=minor&bug_severity=trivial&bug_severity=enhancement&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=REOPENED&columnlist=product%2Ccomponent%2Cchangeddate%2Cbug_severity%2Cpriority%2Cshort_desc&keywords=easy&keywords_type=allwords&order=changeddate%20DESC%2Cproduct%2Ccomponent)

GNOME
=====

'**Gnome-love**' is the loving tag for the easy bugs who want to get
started with the GNOME. If you ever visit the GNOME homepage: the
"**Getting Involved**" link is clearly visible in header menubar.
Anyways here is the
[link](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=keywords%3Agnome-love)
if you don't want to search :)

GNOME maintains a guide for the newcomers:
<https://wiki.gnome.org/NewcomersTutorial>

If you want to know on how to submit your first patch, read this :
[<https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeLove/SubmittingPatches>](https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeLove/SubmittingPatches)

If you want to build the code, then just build it from here:
[<https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeLove/JhbuildIntroduction>](https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeLove/JhbuildIntroduction)

Documentation:
[<https://developer.gnome.org/>](https://developer.gnome.org/)

Apache
======

Apache maintains quite a number of projects. project.apache.org lists a
catalog of more than 140 projects in which one can start contributing.
The New Comers section is an easy read on how to get started in Apache,
[<http://community.apache.org/newcomers/index.html>](http://community.apache.org/newcomers/index.html)

Getting Involved wit Apache Software Foundation:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am an active Python/Django developer for a couple of years. So, I'm
adding on how can one start contributing to Python / Django

Python
======

To start with contributing with Python, just head over to the
**Developer's Guide**
([<http://docs.python.org/devguide/>](http://docs.python.org/devguide/)
). It starts with cloning the repository in your system tell goes on to
tell how can you check for the easy fixes.

The developer guide mentions that how can you start with making
documentation fixes, then move up to fix small bugs. Once you get
acquainted you can start taking up easy bugs.

-   READ:
    [<http://docs.python.org/devguide/fixingissues.html>](http://docs.python.org/devguide/fixingissues.html)
-   Issue Tracker: [<http://bugs.python.org/>](http://bugs.python.org/)
-   Easy Issues: [<http://goo.gl/NzJuDp>](http://goo.gl/NzJuDp)

Django
======

Django is a Python based web-framework used by some really big companies
e.g. Disqus, Instagram, Transifex etc. To start contributing in Django,
head over to the page [Contributing to
Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/internals/contributing/).

This page lists down the links to mailing list, IRC channel, Issue
Tracker.

-   Getting Involved in Django:
    [<https://code.djangoproject.com/#Gettinginvolved>](https://code.djangoproject.com/#Gettinginvolved)

Like most of the open source project Django too has easy fixes for the
new contributors.

-   Little Easy Improvement -
    <https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/LittleEasyImprovements>
-   Easy pickings -
    <https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status>=!closed&easy=1

The "Little Easy Improvement" also mentions issue for which one can send
patches for
[documentation](https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=!closed&needs_docs=1&order=priority),
[writing
tests](https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=!closed&needs_tests=1&order=priority),
or improving the
[codebase](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/LittleEasyImprovements).

Django maintains a page to advice new contributors:
[<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/internals/contributing/new-contributors/>](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/internals/contributing/new-contributors/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contributing to Open Source does not enforce you to contribute only to a
well-known community. There is a huge collection of open source projects
available on websites like [Github](https://github.com/),
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/) , [Google
Code](https://code.google.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
etc. I also enforce on the fact that just open source contribution does
not help. One need to work on side-project for ideas to keep flowing out
of his brain.

I also you like to quote a few lines from a nice [blog
post](http://blog.codecombat.com/reasons-why-you-shouldnt-hack-on-open-source-projects)

> `You shouldn't become an artist so you can be famous, but because there's art inside of you that will kill you if you don't let it out. You shouldn't found a startup to make money, but because it's your life's work. And you shouldn't hack on open source projects because someone told you that your GitHub profile is your new resume, but because you want to code socially.`

Once you start contributing, you start interacting to people via IRC,
mailing lists. I strongly suggest you to go through the etiquette an
organization follows. In general roll your eyes through this
presentation to get a brief of it.
