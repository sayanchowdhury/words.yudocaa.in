[Fedora Pune Meetup](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Meetup_Pune_August_2016) for the month of August 2016 happened today at our usual
location. We had in total 12 people turning out for the meetup.

The event started with introductions and we had two new comers joining us this
time, [Trishna](https://github.com/trishnaguha) and [Prathamesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prathamesh20592).

This time the event was mostly foccused around re-writing the [GNU C Library
Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/documentation.html) using reStructuredText and Sphinx. This task was decided during
the release event that we had last month. We did create a Etherpad link to
maintain the status of the task[1](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/glibc).

The aim is to build a modern version, good looking version of the GNU C Library
Manual.

In today's meetup, we sat down and tried completing the chapters we picked. A
couple of us sent a [PRs](https://github.com/dgplug/glibcdocs/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr) to the docs repo that we are maintaing in
[Github](https://github.com/dgplug/glibcdocs). The generated [read the
docs](http://glibcdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
can be seen [here](http://glibcdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

If you are planning to contribute, ping /me (sayan) or kushal in #dgplug
channel on Freenode.
