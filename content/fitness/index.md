A thread to lose weight, and see a healthier version of me, v2021.6?. This is inspired from closely following
[Priyanka](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html) and [Jason](https://cb.janusworx.com/notice/A0SCk8KhBHOfqEOURU)

In the ending months of 2020, I started with regularly doing a form of excercise be
it skipping, walking, or HIIT. This has helped me lower the rest heartbeat which had
increased to a high of >95. Now, after 3 months it's down to staying in the 70 range.
Somedays even staying in the 65-70 range.

To explain the jargons:

- hw: highest weight
- sw: starting weight
- cw: current weight
- gw: goal weight

A good week of fun, though I'm guilty of not exercising daily towards the end, and
partying over the week (controlled one). In the beginning of the week, I was
dropping quick, as low as 77.7 kgs. Good thing about that is it is below my goal
weight but ended the week with 78.15 kgs. Also, I'm trying to fix my diet, not by
eating less. Actually I've been eating a lot, a lot, compared to what I was eating
at the beginning of the journey. Though most of them are fruits, and veggies.
Still 3rd week is too early to say about habits. Onwards to 4th week! Hopes are
high to lose the first goal weight.

A mixed week. I was sick, but continued to exercise on a couple of days. I was
dropping fast, to 78.70 kgs on Friday, so pulled to brakes and gave some time
to the body to recover from fever as well as the fatigue from exercises. I'm
not looking to drop fast in a unhealthy manner. Treated myself with a cheat day
on Sunday. Third week! Here I come!

### January 11, 2021

A good week. I'm down by 1.5 kgs, but since this is just the first week I'm not
getting my expectations high. Hope to have a good second week.
