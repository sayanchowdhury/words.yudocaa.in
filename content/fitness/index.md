A thread to lose weight, and see a healthier version of me, v2021.6?. This is inspired from closely following
[Priyanka](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html) and [Jason](https://cb.janusworx.com/notice/A0SCk8KhBHOfqEOURU)

In the ending months of 2020, I started with regularly doing a form of excercise be
it skipping, walking, or HIIT. This has helped me lower the rest heartbeat which had
increased to a high of >95. Now, after 3 months it's down to staying in the 70 range.
Somedays even staying in the 65-70 range.

To explain the jargons:

- hw: highest weight
- sw: starting weight
- cw: current weight
- gw: goal weight

- hf: highest fat %
- sf: starting fat %
- cf: current fat %
- gf: goal fat %

The log will be updated weekly with the latest first. Incase you want to start from the beginning, [jump here](#january-11-2021)

Ok, lets start.

Update after a long time. March was mostly keeping the weight constant. I dropped
only a kilo over the month, which was deliberately. The next step would be to drop
the fat percentage so I'm planning to track the same.


### March 1, 2021

We are at another milestone! 8th week of tracking daily and weekly. There were
a lot of ups and downs. But this time it feels like Jan was soooo long back, and
I started so long back. Feels like ages.

I completed 100kms walk this month and bunch of challenges on Connect (Badges! for win)

Some other thoughts, I bought two tshirts few months back which were tight as hell.
The t-shirts were pricey and I was not sure if I was doing the right decision.

Yesterday, I wore the tshirts and they were a beautiful fit. These small things
really make you happy and helps attaining the "Love for Boredom".

Today I feel like Goals are overrated, Journeys are underrated. There should be
perfect balance between them.


*pats on the back again*

Let's see what awaits next month but as I said last month, every small milestones needs
celebrations! :')

March here I come. You are going to be tough!

Nope, Nope! Pretty tough week. I was forcing myself to do things, though I did
hit 8 kms walk in between. My vO2 max went down. I'm planning to change a couple
of things, you can see more in the future logs.

But I'm happy because this is the first time I've hit 76ish since the beginning.
Last week of the month. Hope to enter 75 bracket.

First increase in the weekly log. Could not help this week. I though I could
manage, and almost did, I was at 77ish on Sunday. I ended up having a invitation
on Sunday at I was bombarded with food.

4 days of this week was us partying, so this is kind of acceptable.

Let's see what the next week holds for me.

A good week of fun, though I'm guilty of not exercising daily towards the end, and
partying over the week (controlled one). In the beginning of the week, I was
dropping quick, as low as 77.7 kgs. Good thing about that is it is below my goal
weight but ended the week with 78.15 kgs. Also, I'm trying to fix my diet, not by
eating less. Actually I've been eating a lot, a lot, compared to what I was eating
at the beginning of the journey. Though most of them are fruits, and veggies.
Still 3rd week is too early to say about habits. Onwards to 4th week! Hopes are
high to lose the first goal weight.

### January 18, 2021

A mixed week. I was sick, but continued to exercise on a couple of days. I was
dropping fast, to 78.70 kgs on Friday, so pulled to brakes and gave some time
to the body to recover from fever as well as the fatigue from exercises. I'm
not looking to drop fast in a unhealthy manner. Treated myself with a cheat day
on Sunday. Third week! Here I come!

### January 11, 2021

```
- cw: 80.05 kgs (11/01/2021)

A good week. I'm down by 1.5 kgs, but since this is just the first week I'm not
getting my expectations high. Hope to have a good second week.
