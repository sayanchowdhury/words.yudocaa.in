A thread to lose weight, and see a healthier version of me, v2021.6?. This is inspired from closely following
[Priyanka](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html) and [Jason](https://cb.janusworx.com/notice/A0SCk8KhBHOfqEOURU)

In the ending months of 2020, I started with regularly doing a form of excercise be
it skipping, walking, or HIIT. This has helped me lower the rest heartbeat which had
increased to a high of >95. Now, after 3 months it's down to staying in the 70 range.
Somedays even staying in the 65-70 range.

To explain the jargons:

- hw: highest weight
- sw: starting weight
- cw: current weight
- gw: goal weight

The log will be updated weekly with the latest first. Incase you want to start from the beginning, [jump here](#january-11-2021)

Ok, lets start.

```
- hw: 81.55 kgs (04/01/2021)
- sw: 81.55 kgs (04/01/2021)

A mixed week. I was sick, but continued to exercise on a couple of days. I was
dropping fast, to 78.70 kgs on Friday, so pulled to brakes and gave some time
to the body to recover from fever as well as the fatigue from exercises. I'm
not looking to drop fast in a unhealthy manner. Treated myself with a cheat day
on Sunday. Third week! Here I come!

### January 11, 2021

```
- cw: 80.05 kgs (11/01/2021)

- gw1: 78 kgs
- gw2: 75 kgs
- gw3: 73 kgs
- gw4: 70 kgs
- gw5: 67 kgs
```

A good week. I'm down by 1.5 kgs, but since this is just the first week I'm not
getting my expectations high. Hope to have a good second week.
