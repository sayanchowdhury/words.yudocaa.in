A thread to lose weight, and see a healthier version of me, v2021.6?. This is inspired from closely following
[Priyanka](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html) and [Jason](https://cb.janusworx.com/notice/A0SCk8KhBHOfqEOURU)

In the ending months of 2020, I started with regularly doing a form of excercise be
it skipping, walking, or HIIT. This has helped me lower the rest heartbeat which had
increased to a high of >95. Now, after 3 months it's down to staying in the 70 range.
Somedays even staying in the 65-70 range.

To explain the jargons:

- hw: highest weight
- sw: starting weight
- cw: current weight
- gw: goal weight

The log will be updated weekly with the latest first. Incase you want to start from the beginning, [jump here](#january-11-2021)

Ok, lets start.

```
- hw: 81.55 kgs (04/01/2021)
- sw: 81.55 kgs (04/01/2021)
```

### January 11, 2021

```
- cw: 80.05 kgs (11/01/2021)

- gw1: 78 kgs
- gw2: 75 kgs
- gw3: 73 kgs
- gw4: 70 kgs
- gw5: 67 kgs
```

A good week. I'm down by 1.5 kgs, but since this is just the first week I'm not
getting my expectations high. Hope to have a good second week.
