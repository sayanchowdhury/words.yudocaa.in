A thread to lose weight, and see a healthier version of me, v2024.6?. This is inspired from closely following
[Priyanka](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html) and [Jason](https://janusworx.com/fitness/)

16 weeks until June, Let's see how I fare. I started a similar challenge in 2021, but motivations then and now
are quite different.

To explain the jargons:

- hw: highest weight
- sw: starting weight
- cw: current weight
- gw: goal weight

The log will be updated weekly with the latest first. Incase you want to start from the beginning, [jump here](#february-11-2024)

For daily updates, check the [daily fitness log](/log/daily/2024)

Ok, lets start.

```
- hw: 85.9 kgs (05/02/2024)
- sw: 85.9 kgs (05/02/2024)
```

### February 12, 2024

```
- cw: 83.9 kgs (12/02/2024)

- gw0: 81 kgs
- gw1: 78 kgs
- gw2: 75 kgs
- gw3: 73 kgs
- gw4: 70 kgs
```

Good first week of tracking, I tried to eat healthy, workout and move. I failed
bunch of times but I kept moved ahead and looking to the next day. Starting few
days the drop was quite huge. Maybe water weight from the past days, but then it
stabilized at 83.7 kgs, so all the drop of after that is what I lost. First, goal
weight is still a bit far hopefully in next 2-3 weeks.

Hello 2024!

2023 surely hasn't been a good year in terms of staying healthy. I've been eating
a lot, and that shows. I've gained 15 kgs in a just a span of a year, and I don't
feel well. I've a trek towards the end of the year and I need to start working out
and feel stronger. Be light and swift!
