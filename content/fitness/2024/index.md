A thread to lose weight, and see a healthier version of me, v2024.6?. This is inspired from closely following
[Priyanka](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html) and [Jason](https://janusworx.com/fitness/)

16 weeks until June, Let's see how I fare. I started a similar challenge in 2021, but motivations then and now
are quite different.

To explain the jargons:

- hw: highest weight
- sw: starting weight
- cw: current weight
- gw: goal weight

The log will be updated weekly with the latest first. Incase you want to start from the beginning, [jump here](#february-11-2024)

Ok, lets start.

- sw: 85.9 kgs (05/02/2024)
```

Hello 2024!

2023 surely hasn't been a good year in terms of staying healthy. I've been eating
a lot, and that shows. I've gained 15 kgs in a just a span of a year, and I don't
feel well. I've a trek towards the end of the year and I need to start working out
and feel stronger. Be light and swift!
