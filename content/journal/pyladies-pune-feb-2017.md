The [PyLadies Pune](http://pune.pyladies.com/) February Meetup was held on 
6th Feb at [reserved-bit](https://reserved-bit.com/). 
[Kushal](https://kushaldas.in/) took a session on 
[MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) on the 
[MicroBit](https://www.microbit.co.uk/) boards. 
Thanks to [@ntoll](http://ntoll.org/) for sending over the MicroBits for workshops.

I reached down to the venue a bit late. On reaching the venue, Kushal told me
that he forgot the boards at home and I went to his place to pick the
MicroBits.

Most of the participants were regular participants for the meetup so Kushal
took a quick course on Python. After lunch, they started referring the
documentation for the 
[MicroBit - MicroPython](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and played around with the device by displaying their name, using the 
button to simulate actions.

During the end of the workshop, Kushal demoed the radio module and that turned
out to be the most interesting part of the workshop. Kushal sent the first
radio message "Hello PyLadies" and all the other peeps were able to see the
message in their MicroBit. After that everyone started sending out messages to
each other. [Nisha](https://nisha.reserved-bit.com/) ran out of the hackerspace
to check the range of the radio.

The meetup ended after a small discussion about [PyCon
Pune](https://pune.pycon.org).
