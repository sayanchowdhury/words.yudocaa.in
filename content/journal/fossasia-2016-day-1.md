FOSSASIA 2016, Asia's premier conference on Free and Open Software was held at
Science Center, Singapore.

I arrived Singapore 18th morning, the same day the event was starting. Due to
track issues, the metro was running late and I reached the venue around 1100
local time. I directly went to the auditorium where the event was happening. I
had already missed the morning talks. It was Tea break when I reached.

After the Tea break, I attended talk on YouthMobile by Davide Storti, followed
by Cat Allman's talk about the Science and Open Source Program at
Google. I also attended the talk on _The Other Nefertiti_ by Jan Nikolai
Nelles.

After lunch, I returned back as I did not sleep for 2 nights and was having a
bad headache. I badly needed some sleep and get ready for next day talks.
