[The Fedora Project](https://getfedora.org/) announced the release of [Fedora
21 on December 09, 2014](http://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-21/). To
celebrate the release a [Fedora 21 release party]
(https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Release_Party_F21_Bangalore) was organized at
Red Hat, Bangalore with the help of Archit and Humble.

The event was scheduled to start at 10AM but people started coming in from
9:30AM itself. Around 40 people turned up among them a good number were college
students.

The release party finally started at 10:30AM by [Archit]
(https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Arcolife) who gave an introduction of
Fedora. Then, [rtnpro](http://www.rtnpro.com) gave a talk on what's new in
Fedora 21 release and discussed on the [Fedora.Next
](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora.next) project. He was followed by
[Neependra Khare](http://neependra.net/) who spoke on Project Atomic and
Docker. 

Then we gathered down and celebrated the release of Fedora 21 by cutting a
cake. After the celebration, I started off with explaining the various teams in
Fedora and how to approach to contact the teams. I gave them an overview/demo
of the wiki pages, mailing list and IRC. I briefly explained about the
[join.fedoraproject.org](http://join.fedoraproject.org). The final talk was
given by Sinny on Basic RPM packaging. The talk covered the basic aspects of
RPM packaging and how to create a RPM package of your own. 

At 1:30PM, there was an Open House session where everybody participated
actively sharing their views, queries and experiences. Fedora 21 LiveCDs were
distributed among the attendees. 

Thanks to all the organizers for organizing an awesome Fedora 21 release party.
Looking forward to be part of other Fedora events in future.
