On 15th January 2016, we had our first [Fedora
meetup](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_meetup_Pune_Janurary_2016) at
Pune. The venue was earlier decided to be Red Hat office, Pune but due to
unavailability of space the meetup was moved to my apartment.

The meetup was scheduled to start around 14:30 IST but with people pouring in a
bit late, we started the event at 15:00 IST. The turnout was good and much more
than what we had expected with a total of 18 people turning out. 4 Fedora
Ambasaador were present at the meetup,
[Praveen](https://kumar-pravin.blogspot.com/),
[Siddesh](http://journal.siddhesh.in/), [Kushal](https://kushaldas.in/) and /me.

The meetup started off with a round of introduction. As couple of them where
first-timers, Kushal and Siddesh started talking on how to start contributing
to FOSS from a programmer's perspective.

Then, I started off with introduction of
[Bugyou](https://sayanchowdhury.dgplug.org/introducing-bugyou/). I explained
the architecture, working and the future plans for Bugyou. Next, Kushal
explained the automatic testing of the Cloud/Atomic images in Fedora and also
gave a small hands-on demo of the [Tunir](https://github.com/kushaldas/tunir)
and [Tunirtests](https://github.com/kushaldas/tunirtests)

Praveen later took and hands-on workshop of Ansible. He showed them
step-by-step process of writing Inventory, Playbooks etc and completed with an 
installation of Apache. After the hands-on, the participants tried their hands
on Ansible by writing a script to copy a file from one place to another.

At the end, we discussed regarding the future meetups, what all topics we could
discuss on etc. Our next meetup would be on 22nd January, 2016 from 1700 IST.
We were request to talk on RPM Packaging, a session on C Programming by Siddesh and
Python 2 to 3 migration.
