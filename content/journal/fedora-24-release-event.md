On 9th July 2016, we had our [Fedora 24 release party](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Release_Party_F24_Pune) in Pune. The release party
took place at my place. We saw a lot of familiar faces from our regular Fedora
Meetup.

[Chandan Kumar](http://chandankumar.dgplug.org/) started the event with
explaining the new features in Fedora 24. People discussed on how things has
changed in Fedora 24. Parag and Siddhesh talked on how it's important to learn
things and people chipped in with their ideas. Siddhesh also talked on few
project ideas in glibc. We also discussed [Autocloud](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/autocloud/) and how it works.

During the event we planned to rework on the glibc documentation to make it
more readable. Sadly, I could not get pics.
