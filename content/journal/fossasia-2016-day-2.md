I left early for the venue as haseeb had the first talk of the day and I was
volunteering for the Python track.

The day started off with a talk by Stephanie Taylor on _Introduction to GSoC,
and GCI_. She talked about the programs Google Summer of Code and Google Code
In. She shared some statistics from the past years. The students of GCI last
year completed more than 4k tasks, among them 1k+ was done by the students
under FOSSASIA organization.

After the talk, I moved to Pauling Hall to host the Python Track. The track
started of with a keynote talk by Kushal. The first talk of the day was by Ivan
Zimine on _Test driven development with pytest_.

The next talk was by me. I was talking about the Fedora Infrastructure, how the
projects within the Fedora Infrastructure communicate and how one can start
contributing. During the Q/A session, people enquired if someone from Singapore
contributes to the Fedora Infrastructure projects and How we decide upon which
projects to work on and How do we prioritize?
