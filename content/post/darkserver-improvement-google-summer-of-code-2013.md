It’s better later than never. It’s been two week since the Google Summer of
Code 2013 results were announced and I am glad to say that I got selected
this year.

I will be working on Darkserver Improvement under Fedora. One can see a
draft of my proposal here. My mentor is [Kushal Das](http://kushaldas.in) and i am really helpful for
helping me out in the whole process both in code and application.
