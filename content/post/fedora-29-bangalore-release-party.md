**23rd November 2018**

The Fedora community of Bangalore assembled at the Red Hat Bangalore office. The event was scheduled to start at 1300, but the lunch at the office postponed the event by 45 mins.

Sumantro kicked off the event with a small introduction, following which Vipul gave an introduction of open source with a short choco-chip story.

Sumantro back on stage after that talking about the "What's coming next?", from discussing about GNOME/Pantheon, to Python 2 deprecation, to Ansible, to IoT, to Modularity.

Sinny talked and demoed the shiny new Fedora Silverblue.

Finally, the cupcakes were revealed and the event ended with a group photo.
