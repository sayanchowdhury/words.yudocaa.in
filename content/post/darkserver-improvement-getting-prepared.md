The Google Summer of Code 2013 results was declared on 27th May 2013, in
between my semester exam so i had no time to devote until the end of my
semester exams and /me returning back to my home.

With the beginning of the 2nd week of June, I started to hack around with the
project, Darkserver. The project is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/kushaldas/darkserver).

That week was pretty much a reading week rather than coding week as I had to
go through all kinds of documentation. Darkserver is implemented using
retask, which uses Redis. Though, I earlier little knowledge about the
topics, I went thoroughly through the Redis documentation and googled more
about Redis.

I also had to go through the retask documentation. Finally, I went once
again went through darkserver code and created diagrams, this will me
helping out the solve out the task and helping me to know where to hack the
code to get the work running.
